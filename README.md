# Blurry-furry Koala
Here, the expectation is to understand and code one of the clustering algorithms (K-Means) and realize image compression for various values of neighbors (k) and 3 different initializations of initial centroids/means.

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Steps achieved

- [X] Able to achieve the cyclic process of computing a centroid and associating a data point to the respective centroid.
- [X] Utilized repmat (matlib - NumPy) before feeding the image to output matrix

## Challenges faced 
(Resolved challenges are ticked)

- [X] Random initialization of centroids made the replication of results difficult to achieve
